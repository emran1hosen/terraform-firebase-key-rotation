# complete Terraform configuration that you can use to automatically rotate your Firebase Admin SDK key:

You need to populate these variables with the appropriate values for your project.

This Terraform configuration creates a new key, rotates the old key and then destroy the old key. You can schedule this configuration to run on a regular basis using a tool like cron on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows to ensure that your key is rotated at regular intervals.

It's also important to monitor the key rotation process to ensure that the new keys are being created and the old ones are being deleted as expected, so that you can catch and fix any issues that arise. Also it's important to keep the service account file safe and secure, and don't share it publicly.

You can use Terraform remote state or Terraform remote backends to store this state file in a secure location so that it can only be accessed by authenticated users.
